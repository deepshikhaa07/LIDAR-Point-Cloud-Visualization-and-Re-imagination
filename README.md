# 🌐 LiDAR Point Cloud to 3D Mesh Visualization in Blender 🛰️🛠️

Welcome to the official repository for **LiDAR Point Cloud Procurement, Segmentation, and Mesh Creation for Enhanced Visualization and Re-imagination in Blender**! 🎯

This project presents a streamlined **5-stage pipeline** to convert raw LiDAR point cloud data (`.las` files) into high-quality, editable **3D mesh models** using **CloudCompare**, **Blender**, and supporting tools like **Anaconda** and **NumPy**. The focus lies on transforming complex geospatial data into visually meaningful models for **urban planning**, **academic research**, and **creative design**.

## 🧩 Key Features

- 📥 **LiDAR Data Acquisition & Masking**  
  Import point cloud data from reliable sources with metadata parsing and classification.

- ✂️ **Point Cloud Segmentation**  
  Segment and isolate structures like buildings, roads, and vegetation.

- 🧮 **Mesh Generation**  
  Use NumPy and CloudCompare to create structured 3D surface meshes from segmented data.

- 🎨 **Modeling in Blender**  
  Visualize, refine, and re-imagine 3D environments using Blender's advanced toolset.

- 🔄 **Modular Workflow**  
  Easily customizable and scalable for projects of varying complexity.
